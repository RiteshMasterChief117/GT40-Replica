# GT40-E Project (EV Hot Rod)

This is a 1:1 scale CAD development project for a GT40-inspired electric vehicle, built using OnShape and Formula E Studentâ€“grade EV components.

## Structure
- `cad/`: STEP and STL files for chassis, canopy, and more.
- `assets/`: Image references and render outputs.
- `docs/`: Technical diagrams, wiring plans, etc.

## Goals
- 1:1 scale for design iteration
- Future scaling to 90% Formula Student footprint
- Full open-source design with Indian-sourced components wherever possible

## Status
- Phase 1: CAD layout in progress (OnShape)
- Phase 2: Scaling and prototype assembly
